routh-hurwitz-calc
==================

An analysis tool for evaluating the stability of a Linear-Time-Invariant(LTI) system.
This tool is most useful in the field of control systems design.

The current version can evaluate a numerical LTI system with no variables.
In the next iteration we will allow for a proportional gain variable k and present an improved
and streamlined user interface.

This project uses an exciting library for in-browser use of python: <a href = "http://www.skulpt.org/">skulpt.js</a>
